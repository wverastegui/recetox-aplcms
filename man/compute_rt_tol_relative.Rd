\usage{
compute_rt_tol_relative(
  breaks,
  max.num.segments,
  aver.bin.size,
  number_of_samples,
  chr,
  min.bins,
  max.bins,
  do.plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{max.num.segments}{the maximum number of segments.}

\item{aver.bin.size}{The average bin size to determine the number of equally spaced points in the kernel density estimation.}

\item{number_of_samples}{The number of spectra in this analysis.}

\item{chr}{retention time of all peaks in all profiles in the study.}

\item{min.bins}{the minimum number of bins to use in the kernel density estimation. It overrides aver.bin.size when too few observations are present.}

\item{max.bins}{the maximum number of bins to use in the kernel density estimation. It overrides aver.bin.size when too many observations are present.}

\item{do.plot}{Indicates whether plot should be drawn.}
}
\value{
rt_tol_relative the elution time tolerance.
This conditional makes sure that length(s) is <= max.num.segments
If False, length(s) =  max.num.segments, and s[i] is the largest
integer no greater than the corresponding element. Otherwise
length(s) =  length(breaks) - 1
This loop creates a vector with distances between rt peaks. Distances
are stored in a triangular matrix and converted to a vector subsequently.
Vector length should be < 100, otherwise, vector is 
constructed extracting only 100 samples.

Compute the elution time tolerance based on the kernel density estimation.
It plots the fitting function if set to TRUE.
